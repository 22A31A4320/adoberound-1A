🎥 Demo Video Description: Adobe Hackathon Round 1A
This screen recording demonstrates the functionality of my solution for Round 1A of the Adobe "Connecting the Dots" Hackathon. The app is built using Streamlit and performs intelligent document analysis on PDF files.

📌 Key Highlights in the Video:
PDF Upload Interface

The user uploads a .pdf document through the Streamlit UI.

The PDF is parsed and processed entirely on-device (offline compatible).

Challenge 1A Selected

The user selects “Challenge 1A: PDF Title & Heading Extraction.”

The app extracts the document title and all section headings.

Real-Time Output Display

The extracted outline (title + H1, H2, H3 headings) is displayed as a table.

The data is shown along with page numbers and heading levels.

JSON Preview & Download

The app generates a JSON output conforming to Adobe’s required format.

The JSON can be downloaded directly from the UI.

Performance

The extraction completes within seconds, complying with the 10-second execution limit.

No external API calls are made, ensuring offline compatibility.

💡 Technologies Used
pdfminer.six for layout-based PDF parsing

Streamlit for UI

Heuristics for heading level detection (font size, boldness, structure)
